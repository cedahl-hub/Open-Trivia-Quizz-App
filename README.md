Goal: create a mini quiz application. Use the Open Trivia Database API found here: https://opentdb.com/

There should be at least two separate components that pass props with the following sections:

1. üè† Home page - when the app loads it should show a form that contains the following:
Welcome message | Title of the Page | Instructions
    - Figure out a way, that blends with the UI, to give the user instructions so they know exactly what to do
A text box and label for the user's first name
A dropdown and label for the question category - the user must have at least 4 choices that the API supports
A dropdown and label for the question difficulty - use all three choices the API supports
A submit button
An error message, stopping the form submit, if any of these inputs aren't filled out or selected.  They are all required.
NOTE: The input in the text box and dropdowns must be stored in a state object, NOT in three separate state variables  
2. ‚ùìQuestion Form - When the user submits the form to get the question, another form should appear with the following:
The question - the type will always be multiple choice
The answers as a radio button group with labels - these must be looped through and displayed, not pulled individually 
A submit button
A conditional render that will show a message if the API call encounters an error
An error message, stopping the form submit, if an answer isn't chosen.  
3. ‚òëÔ∏è Results Section - When the user submits their answer, another section should appear with the following:
A message containing the user's name, telling them whether they answered the question wrong or right
A message telling them the correct answer if they answered incorrectly
A button that will allow them to start over and get another question
